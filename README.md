# HASCID: The First Dataset for Automatic Spectral Calibration of Hyperspectral Images

We are proud to introduce **HASCID**, the **first dataset designed specifically for the task of automatic spectral calibration** of hyperspectral images (HSIs). This dataset addresses the critical challenge of minimizing illumination variability without relying on manual intervention or physical references.

## Key Highlights

- **Task Proposal**:  
  We propose the novel task of **automatic spectral calibration**, aiming to advance the robustness of hyperspectral imaging in diverse real-world scenarios.

- **Dataset Characteristics**:  
  - **Camera**: Specim IQ, featuring a spectral resolution of 3nm across the 400â€“1000nm range.  
  - **Recording Method**: Each scene is captured twice:  
    1. **Without reference board**: Captures raw scene data.  
    2. **With white reference board**: Records illumination conditions under the same settings.  
  This approach ensures asynchronous yet precise pairing of **uncalibrated** and **calibrated** HSIs, effectively minimizing illumination variability.  
  - **Dark Current Correction**: Dark current noise, intrinsic to the camera sensor, is carefully recorded and subtracted during post-processing, ensuring high data accuracy.

- **Scene Diversity**:  
  The dataset encompasses a wide range of **urban and natural scenes**, captured under various weather conditions, lighting scenarios, and times of day.

- **Benchmarking Standard**:  
  HASCID establishes a new standard for spectral calibration by combining real-world scene variability with rigorous illumination recording, offering a robust foundation for testing and advancing spectral calibration techniques.

## Dataset Splits

The file `real_light_split.json` provides predefined **'train'**, **'validation'**, and **'test'** splits of the dataset, enabling standardized evaluation and comparison across different methods.

## Synthetic Data Generation

The script `gen_sim_data.py` can be used to generate the **HASCID-E** dataset, a synthetic extension of HASCID, by simulating 10 different illumination conditions recorded in `ill_sim.pkl`. This allows researchers to explore and benchmark their methods under controlled, yet diverse, illumination variations.
